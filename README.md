# JustAGrid
JustAGrid is a basic stylesheet that adds grid funtionality to a page without adding any styling (Though you should probably just use flexbox or the css grid layout). You can view a example [here](https://dylngg.github.io/justAGrid)

## Getting Started

To get started, just download the folder and move the css file into wherever you keep your css files.

Then, just read up on the docs in [docs/index.html](https://dylngg.github.io/justAGrid/docs)

## Why you should care about it
You shouldn't. You should probably just use flexbox or the css grid layout. ~~However, justAGrid provides similar functionality and a simple usage while supporting every browser since IE8. It's perfect for a basic website, where you want a grid, but don't want all those styles that come with other grid frameworks~~.

Plus, 
- It's only 115 lines of code unminified
- It won't overrule any of your custom styles

### One Last Thing
Credit must be given, where credit is due. I modified the css grid from [GetSkeletion](http://getskeleton.com), which was created by Dave Gamache. It's a great basic boilerplate with amazing styles for a basic project.
